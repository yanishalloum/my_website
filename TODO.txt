### MyCaps Project

TODO:
 - Issue when accessing the "Edit Cap" section: 
 "Symfony 5 Error: Object of class Proxies\__CG__\App\Entity\Inventory could not be converted to string"
 Issue resolved by adding __toString method to Inventory.php 
 - Issue regarding fixtures: override reference
 - Implement navigation between Inventory and Caps sections.
 - Implement twig template.
 - Improve website aestheticism.
 - Centralise access to different sections using html instead of having to access by hand the address (eg: 127.0.0.1:8000/cap)
